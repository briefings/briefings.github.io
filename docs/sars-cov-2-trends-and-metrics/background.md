## About

<p>This project is focused on measures, metrics, trends, and models for understanding and anticipating the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019).  The measures, metrics, and models are explored/developed via SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) field tests data; tests data and measures thereof.</p>

The country in focus is the United States, and the data sources are [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com){:target="\_blank"}, <a href='https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19' target="\_blank">Johns Hopkins University & Medicine</a>, <a href='https://www.census.gov/en.html' target="\_blank">United States Census Bureau</a>, and the [United States Environment Protection Agency](https://www.epa.gov){:target="\_blank"}.

<p>The graphs and tables of results, alongside explanatory notes and methods, are being prepared for a blog post.  Initially, some notes/observations will be outlined here.</p>


## Explorations

:--- |:---
[Impending outbreaks](https://briefings.github.io/sars/journal/pages/delta.html) | Is it possible to anticipate outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 infections via running percentage changes of cumulative observations per $\mathbf{\small{100K}}$ people, <span class="tooltip">w.r.t.<span class="tooltiptext">with respect to</span></span> a set of time periods?
[Trends of *observations*<br>*per 100K*](https://briefings.github.io/sars/journal/pages/capita.html) | The veracity, or usefulness, of positive test rates â€“ and similar rates, e.g., death positive, death hospitalised, etc. - depends on (a) underlying data & standards, and (b) calculation standards.  Bearing these in mind, and their associated issues, what is discernible from unambiguously defined rates trends?
[Measures of variation,<br>location, and symmetry](https://briefings.github.io/sars/journal/pages/spreads.html) | Simple illustrations of observations-variations across states.
